      <p>
        Hello, I am Collins Obinna and I am a web developer. I live and work in
        somewhere warm. I spend most of my day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript (and its endless list of frameworks). I enjoy coding and the
        challenge of learning something new everyday. You can also find me at
        github{" "}
